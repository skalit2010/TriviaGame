# TriviaGame
https://skalit2010.github.io/TriviaGame/

An Exo themed trivia game that uses JavaScript timing events for each question and jQuery to dynamically generate HTML.

### How It Works
* The game shows only one question at a time, and the question is displayed until the player answers it or their time runs out.
* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen is generated to congratulate them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed--without user input.
* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
* If the player runs out of time, the app tells the player that time is up, waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the app tells the player they selected the wrong option, waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.
* When there are no remaining questions, the final screen shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
